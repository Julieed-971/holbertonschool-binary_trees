## Description

At the end of this project we should be able to explain :

- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Requirements
